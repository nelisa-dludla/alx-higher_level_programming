# 0x0C. Python - Almost a circle

This project consists of Python classes that are part of a larger framework. The main components include a base class for managing IDs, a rectangle class, and a square class. These classes are designed to handle attributes, validations, and various methods associated with geometric shapes.

models/base.py: Defines the Base class with ID management and utility methods.
models/rectangle.py: Implements the Rectangle class, inheriting from the Base class.
models/square.py: Introduces the Square class, also inheriting from the Rectangle class.
tests/: Contains unit tests to ensure the functionality and correctness of the classes.
