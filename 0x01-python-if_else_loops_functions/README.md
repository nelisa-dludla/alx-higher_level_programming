This directory contains solutions to various if/else, loop and function problems in Python.

## Solutions

### 0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing

File: `0-positive_or_negative.py`

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and print whether the number stored in the variable `number` is positive or negative.

### 1. The last digit

File: `1-last_digit.py`

This program will assign a random signed number to the variable `number` each time it is executed and print the last digit of the number stored in the variable `number`.

### 2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game

File: `2-print_alphabet.py`

This a program prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 3. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off

File: `3-print_alphabt.py`

This program prints the ASCII alphabet (except `q` and `e`), in lowercase, not followed by a new line.

### 4. Hexadecimal printing

File: `4-print_hexa.py`

This program prints all numbers from `0` to `98` in decimal and in hexadecimal.

### 5. 00...99

File: `5-print_comb2.py`

This program  prints numbers from 0 to 99.

### 6. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need

File: `6-print_comb3.py`

This program prints all possible different combinations of two digits.

### 7. islower

File: `7-islower.py`

This function checks for a lowercase character.

### 8. To uppercase

File: `8-uppercase.py`
